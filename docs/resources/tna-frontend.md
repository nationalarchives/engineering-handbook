To avoid repetition and encourage consistency, The National Archives has developed a set of reusable styles and components to help you build services for The National Archives.

## GOV.UK styles

If a service that looks more like GOV.UK is required, [Transfer Digital Record components](https://github.com/nationalarchives/tdr-components) extend the components from [GOV.UK Frontend](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/).
