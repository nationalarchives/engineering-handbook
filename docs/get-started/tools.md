In order to write code, you need an IDE. There are a few free IDEs available:

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com)
- [Brackets](https://brackets.io/)

## Terminal

All operating systems should come with a CLI. A terminal will allow you to run commands and build software without an GUI.

Windows has [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/), Mac OS has [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/terminal/apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac) and Linux usually has a CLI such as Ubuntu's command line.

Some IDEs have terminal built in which leverage the CLI of the OS.
