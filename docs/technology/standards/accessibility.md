# Accessibility

Accessibility means making sure your services can be used by the widest possible audience. Every time you send an email, prepare a presentation, write a post or a report you want as many people as possible to be able to understand it.

As a public body, we are under obligation to provide accessible services.

> All UK service providers have a legal obligation to make reasonable adjustments under the Equality Act 2010 or the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (in Northern Ireland).
>
> If you created a new public sector website on or after 23 September 2018, you need to meet accessibility standards and should have published an accessibility statement. You need to review and update your statement regularly.

## WCAG

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are a set of standards to ensure web-based content is as usable to as many people as possible.

It is broken down into four principles:

- Perceivable
- Operable
- Understandable
- Robust

You can read about the [four principles of accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/intro#understanding-the-four-principles-of-accessibility) from the WCAG guidelines published by W3C.

Each principle has a number of success criteria that have to be met. The full list can be found on the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) published by W3C.

Each criteria is given a level, either *A*, *AA* or *AAA*. A site meeting all the *A* criteria is the least accessible WCAG compliant site and one that meets all the *A*, *AA* and *AAA* criteria is the most accessible.

As of October 2023, WCAG 2.2 is the latest version of the guidelines. GOV.UK have published a guide on [understanding WCAG 2.2](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag).

## Format

### PDFs

Avoid using PDFs where possible.

> Compared with HTML content, information published in a PDF is harder to find, use and maintain. More importantly, unless created with sufficient care PDFs can often be bad for accessibility and rarely comply with open standards.
